Zone 2 (Lensveil) - Design Plan (short)

Goals
- Provide a compact, polished second zone (Lensveil) that teaches a new ability (seeing illusions), offers 2-3 small encounters, and solidifies progression from Zone 1.

Areas
- Entry plaza (teleport arrival) with gate locked until HasSpark.
- Mirror grove (puzzle: identify real vs illusion mirrors using "spark glow").
- Lightbridge encounter (use inner flame to reveal hidden paths and collect 3 Light Shards).
- NPC hub (Solari, guide + quest giver). Dialogue branch influenced by ReflectionChoice (changes tone).

Key Mechanics
- Reveal mechanic: player's inner flame reveals illusions when toggled (short cooldown).
- Shards: Collectible items spawned in visible and hidden spots; once 3 collected, a bridge appears.

Persistence & Rewards
- Store shard count in SaveService (already added). Reward small heal and cosmetic particle on completion.

Assets needed
- Environment props: stones, arches, mirrors, light bridges (use Roblox toolbox placeholders or custom models).
- VFX: shimmer particles for illusions, bridge particle, UI icons.
- NPC portraits (optional): used in dialogue UI.

Acceptance criteria
- Player teleports to Zone2, Solari explains the reveal mechanic.
- Player can use reveal to find and collect 3 shards.
- On completion, collect reward and a portal/marker appears to proceed.
